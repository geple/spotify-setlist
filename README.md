# Spotify Playlist Generator Web App

## Overview

This is a simple web app built with Python and Flask that allows users to create Spotify playlists based on artists they want to discover. The app uses the Spotify API to search for artists, build a playlist, and provide a description of the playlist with the included artists and the tool used for playlist creation.

## Features

- **Artist Search:** Users can search for their favorite artists by name.

- **Artist Selection:** Users can select multiple artists to include in their playlist.

- **Playlist Length:** Users can specify the desired length (number of tracks) for their playlist. A default value is provided.

- **Playlist Name:** Users can set the name of their playlist in a text field.

- **Playlist Creation:** Users can click a button to generate the playlist based on their selections.

- **Playlist Description:** The generated playlist includes a description that lists the artists chosen by the user and mentions the tool used to create the playlist.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of an artist you want to include in your playlist and click the "Search" button.

2. Select one or more artists from the search results.

3. (Optional) Adjust the playlist length and set a custom playlist name.

4. Click the "Generate Playlist" button to create your playlist.

5. View the generated playlist with the included artists and the tool used for its creation.
